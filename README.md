# Introduction-to-Python-Programming---Independent-Project

## Problem Statement<br />
Create a program that performs some computation using the python programming language.<br />
Tigo Telcom provides a mobile subscription plan with 200 minutes of airtime and 200 text messages
for $10 a month. Each additional minute of air time costs $.03, and other text messages cost $.001
each. The customer's bill is also subject to 14% VAT Tax. Write a python program that will read the
no. of minutes and text messages used in a month, then displays the base charge, additional
minutes (if any), other text messages (if any), the tax charged, and the total bill.<br />

A few things to note:<br />
● Your input should be in the form of a dictionary.<br />
● Your output should be more like an SMS message.<br />
● Display the charges in 2 decimal places.<br />
